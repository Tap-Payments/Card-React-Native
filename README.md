# Get your Tap keys

You can always use the example keys within our example app, but we do recommend you to head to our [onboarding](https://register.tap.company/sell) page. You will need to register your `bundle id` to get your `Tap Key` that you will need to activate our `Card SDK`.

# Installation

We got you covered, `card-react-native` can be installed with all possible technologies.

## Node modules

```sh
npm install card-react-native
```

```sh
yarn install card-react-native
```

Then run in your terminal

```swift
cd ios
pod install
pod update
```

# Import the dependency
```Ts
import TapCardView from â€˜card-react-nativeâ€™;
```

# Simple integration
## Simple widget initialisation
```Ts
function MinRequirement() {
  const testRef =
    React.useRef<ITapCardViewInputRef>() as MutableRefObject<ITapCardViewInputRef>;

  return (
    <View
      style={{
        flex: 1,
        alignItems: 'center',
        justifyContent: 'center',
      }}
    >
      <TapCardView

            tokenValue
          );
        }}
        ref={cardSdkRef}
        style={{ width: '100%' }}
        config={{
          merchant: {
            id: '',
          },
          order: {
            amount: 1,
            currency: TapCurrencyCode.SAR,

          );
        }}
      />
    </View>
  );
}
```
## Generate Token
```Ts
const cardSdkRef =
    React.useRef<ITapCardViewInputRef>() as MutableRefObject<ITapCardViewInputRef>;
cardSdkRef.current.generateToken();
```

# Main input documentation
To make our sdk as dynamic as possible, we accept the input in a form of a `dictionary` . We will provide you with a sample full one for reference.
It is always recommended, that you generate this `dictionary` from your server side, so in future if needed you may be able to change the format if we did an update.
