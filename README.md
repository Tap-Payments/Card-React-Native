Tap Card React-Native Wrapper


# Introduction[]()

Before diving into the development process, it's essential to establish the prerequisites and criteria necessary for a successful build. In this step, we'll outline the specific iOS requirements, including the minimum SDK version and other important details you need to consider. Let's ensure your project is set up for success from the very beginning.


# Sample Demo[]()


https://github.com/Tap-Payments/Card-React-Native/assets/121755223/5a926c3b-45f3-4ed8-94e2-e1e69deb55a3



# Step 1: Requirements[]()

-  React native 0.64
- -   A minimum  [Android SDK/API level](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)  of 24+
-  In order to be able to use card scanner functionality, please make sure you added the correct permission key-value in the iOS project info.plist.
    
    ```xml
    <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
    <string>Card SDK needs it for scanner functionality</string>
    ```
- in order to accept online payments on your application, you will need to add at least the Internet permission in the manifest file.
```xml
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" /> //get internet access to complete online payments
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.NFC" />
    <uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.nfc" android:required="true" />
    <uses-feature
      android:name="android.hardware.camera"
      android:required="true" />

```

# Step 2: Get Your Public Keys[]()

While you can certainly use the sandbox keys available within our sample app which you can get by following the  [installation](https://developers.tap.company/docs/android-card-sdk#step-3-installation-using-gradle)  process, however, we highly recommend visiting our  [onboarding](https://register.tap.company/ae/en/sell)  page, there you'll have the opportunity to register your package name and acquire your essential Tap Key for activating Card-iOS integration.


# Step 3: Installation[]()

We got you covered, `card-react-native` can be installed with all possible technologies.

## Node modules

```sh
npm install card-react-native
```

```sh
yarn install card-react-native
```

Then run in your terminal

```swift
cd ios
pod install
pod update
```



# Import the dependency
```Ts
import TapCardView from â€˜card-react-nativeâ€™;
```

# Step 4: Integrating Card-React-Native[]()
This integration offers two distinct options: a simple integration designed for rapid development and streamlined merchant requirements, and an advanced integration that adds extra features for a more dynamic payment integration experience.

## Simple Integration[]()

Here, you'll discover a comprehensive table featuring the parameters applicable to the simple integration. Additionally, you'll explore the various methods for integrating the SDK, either using storyboard to create the layout and then implementing the controllers functionalities by code, or directly using code. Furthermore, you'll gain insights into card tokenization after the initial payment and learn how to receive the callback notifications.

### Parameters[]()
Each parameter is linked to the  [reference](https://developers.tap.company/docs/card-sdk-ios#reference)  section, which provides a more in depth explanation of it.


|Configuration|Description | Required | Type| Sample
|--|--|--| --|--|
| operator| This is the `Key` that you will get after registering you bundle id. | True  | `String`| `let operator  {publicKey: 'pk_test_YhUjg9PNT8oDlKJ1aE2fMRz7'}` |
| scope| Defines the intention of using the `Card-React-native`. | True  | `Scope`| ` let scope = Scope.AuthenticatedToken`|
| purpose| Defines the intention of using the `Token` after generation. | True  | `String`| ` let purpose = "Transaction"` |
| order| This is the `order id` that you created before or `amount` and `currency` to generate a new order.   It will be linked this token. | True  | `Order`| ` let order: = { amount: 1, currency: TapCurrencyCode.SAR, description: '', id: '', , reference : ''}` |


## Simple widget initialisation
```Ts
function MinRequirement() {
  const testRef =
    React.useRef<ITapCardViewInputRef>() as MutableRefObject<ITapCardViewInputRef>;

  return (
    <View
      style={{
        flex: 1,
        alignItems: 'center',
        justifyContent: 'center',
      }}
    >
      <TapCardView
        onSuccess={(tokenValue) => {
          console.log(
            'ðŸš€ ~ file: HomeScreen.tsx:136 ~ HomeScreen ~ tokenValue:',
            tokenValue
          );
        }}
        ref={cardSdkRef}
        style={{ width: '100%' }}
        config={{
          merchant: {
            id: '',
          },
          order: {
            amount: 1,
            currency: TapCurrencyCode.SAR,
          },
          operator: {
            publicKey: 'pk_test_YhUjg9PNT8oDlKJ1aE2fMRz7'
          },
          scope: Scope.AuthenticatedToken,
          customer: {
            nameOnCard: 'Tap Payments',
            editable: true,
            name: [
              {
                first: 'Tap',
                lang: Locale.en,
                middle: 'Company',
                last: 'Payments',
              },
            ],
            contact: {
              phone: {
                number: '88888888',
                countryCode: '+965',
              },
              email: 'tappayments@tap.company',
            },
          },
        }}
        onInvalidInput={(invalidInput: boolean) => {
          console.log(
            'ðŸš€ ~ file: HomeScreen.tsx:145 ~ HomeScreen ~ invalidInput:',
            invalidInput
          );
        }}
      />
    </View>
  );
}
```
###  Tokenise the card[]()

> ðŸ“˜
> 
> A token is like a secret code that stands in for sensitive info, like credit card data. Instead of keeping the actual card info, we use this code. Tokens are hard for anyone to understand if they try to peek, making it a safer way to handle sensitive stuff.

```Ts
const cardSdkRef =
    React.useRef<ITapCardViewInputRef>() as MutableRefObject<ITapCardViewInputRef>;
cardSdkRef.current.generateToken();
```
